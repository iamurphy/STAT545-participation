Welcome to this repo!

This repo will contain all of my files from participation in class for STAT 545A.

They will be organized by "weeks" meaning you will find folders such as "weeks1and2" or "week5", etc...

Within those folders, you can find all relevant files for those weeks. Most will be R Markdown.

Here is a list of the links for each lecture for participation:
